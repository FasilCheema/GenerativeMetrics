# GenerativeMetrics
Repository where work on metrics for generative modelling is done.


Our Paper was accepted to AISTATS 2023 

This repository includes the code for the experiments for the toy models, the relevant algorithms including; our algorithm, the Density and Coverage algorithm, the Improved Precision and Recall. 

We will shortly add the whole set of experiments including the high quality image data experiments.
